    <h2 class="text-xs-center">How does it work</h2>
    <p>
        We provide a simple and easy way to update your progress on the Applachian Trail. The
        idea is to provide a map where the trail is shown as long, as you have hiked it. To
        update your progress you select the last shelter you have passed. The nearest point
        on the trail is used as marker for your progress. You can embed the map on your blog,
        send the link to your friends, or what ever you like to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        We ourselves hiked the AT northbound in 2017. And we had been asked by our family,
        friends and colleagues how they can follow us. The obvious are blogs and photo albums. But
        we thought it would be awesome for them to see the actual miles we hiked. Therefore we
        used and tested this service firsthand in 2017.
